My words, my belief-
Start from scratch, let it be slow,
Put your efforts, it'll gradually grow.
Be strong to follow the path that's narrow,
Improve yourself from the leanings you borrow.
Life is unpredictable, there'll be happiness, there will be sorrow,
Believe in yourself, you'll surely hit the target with an arrow.
