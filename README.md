## Introduction

In this repository, you will find solutions to problems on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, etc., with explanations and optimizations.

This is part of my **180 Days of Code** journey, where I practice various DSA concepts to enhance my coding and problem-solving skills.

## Languages Used

- JavaScript
- Python
- C++
- Java (Optional based on your preference)

Feel free to explore solutions in these languages and understand the core concepts behind each algorithm.

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully and clarify any doubts.
2. **Plan the Approach**: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and plan the solution.
3. **Code the Solution**: Implement the algorithm with time and space complexity in mind.
4. **Optimize**: Review and improve the code to make it more efficient.
5. **Test the Solution**: Validate the solution with multiple test cases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
